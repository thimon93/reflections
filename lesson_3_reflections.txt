When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with multiple people, or when you just want to store a project online instead of locally in case of computer tragedy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

The same reason you would want to have commits be manual. This way, you control what's going on with your project. Someone else might be working on the project might update it and it could potentially overwrite or break what you are locally working on .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When could you use one instead of another?

Forks is when you clone a repo on github. 
Clone is whenever you copy another repo to another location, local or remotely.
Branches are just when you want to work on something without messing with your master code branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This way git can know wether or not you are ahead of the origin/master.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would probably send files over email and use chat to talk about changes. Harder.

When would you want to make changes in a seperate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a seperate branch when you want to do a pull request that resulted in a conflict since you need to fix the conflcits but you also need to do another pull request. This allows for you to be able to keep it clear to the people collaborating what commits happened. If you just pushed, some commit messages would be missed.
